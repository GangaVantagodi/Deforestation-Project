#### REPORT FOR FORESTQUERY INTO GLOBAL DEFORESTATION, 1990 to 2016
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from successes.

### GLOBAL SITUATION
According to the World Bank, the total forest area of the world was 41,282,694.9 sq.km in 1990. As of 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, that number had fallen to 39,958,245.9 sq.km, a loss of 1,324,449 sq.km, or 3.21%.

The forest area lost over this time period is slightly more than the entire land area of Peru listed for the year 2016 (which is 1,279,999.989 sq.km).

### REGIONAL OUTLOOK
In 2016, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 39,958,245.9 sq.km. The region with the highest relative forestation was
Latin American & Caribbean, with 46.2%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 2.1% forestation.

In 1990, the percent of the total land area of the world designated as forest was 41,282,694.9sq.km. The region with the highest relative forestation was
Latin America & Caribbean with 51%, and the region with the lowest relative forestation was Middle East & North Africa, with 1.78% forestation.

![Regional Table](https://github.com/GangaVantagodi/Deforestation-Project/blob/main/Regional%20Table.png)

The only regions of the world that decreased in percent forest area from 1990 to 2016 were Latin America & Caribbean (dropped from 51.03% to 46.16%) and Sub-Saharan Africa (32.19% to 28.79%). All other regions actually increased in forest area over this time period. However, the drop in forest area in the two of mentioned regions was so large, the percent forest area of the world decreased over this time period from 32.42% to 31.38%.

### COUNTRY-LEVEL DETAIL
_A. SUCCESS STORIES_

There is one particularly bright spot in the data at the country level, Iceland. This country actually increased in forest area from 1990 to 2016 by 213.66%. It would be interesting to study what has changed in this country over this time to drive this figure in the data higher. The country with the next largest increase in forest area from 1990 to 2016 was the French Polynesia, but it only saw an increase of 181.2%, much lower than the figure for Iceland.

Russian Federation and China are of course very large countries in total land area, so when we look at the largest percent change in forest area from 1990 to 2016, we arenâ€™t surprised to find a much smaller country listed at the top. Iceland increased in forest area by 213.66% from 1990 to 2016.

_B. LARGEST CONCERNS_

Which countries are seeing deforestation to the largest degree? We can answer this question in two ways. First, we can look at the absolute square kilometer decrease in forest area from 1990 to 2016. The following 3 countries had the largest decrease in forest area over the time period under consideration:

The second way to consider which countries are of concern is to analyze the data by percent decrease.

![Country-Pct](https://github.com/GangaVantagodi/Deforestation-Project/blob/main/Countries-pct.png)

When we consider countries that decreased in forest area percentage the most between 1990 and 2016, we find that 4 of the top 5 countries on the list are in the region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The countries are Togo,Nigeria,Uganda,Mauritania. The 5th country on the list is Honduras, which is in the Latin America & Caribbean region.
